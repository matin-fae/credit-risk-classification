# credit-risk-classification for Module 20 Challenge of Data Analytics Bootcamp </br>
----------------------------------------------------------</br>
Overview:</br>
The purpose of this analysis was to train a logistic regression model to determine whether a sample in a given dataset could be determined, with precision, to be a healthy or high-risk loan.</br>
Results (Overtrained Model):
<ul>
  <li>Accuracy Score: 0.99 (99%)</li>
  <li>Precision Score: 1.00 (100%) / 0.84 (84%)</li>
  <li>Recall Score: 0.99 (99%) / 0.99 (99%)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Summary:<br>
The model fitted with oversampled data maintains its precision when predicting healthy loans. While the precision has slightly decreased for the high-risk loans, the f1-scores and recall have overall improved. This overfitted model may be more appropriate for capturing healthy vs high-risk loans. </br>
Based on the performance metrics shown by the logistic regression model, I would confidently recommend the model for loan classification tasks within a company.</br>
